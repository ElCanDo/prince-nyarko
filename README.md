# Hi, I'm Prince Nyarko (a.k.a ElCanDo) 👋  
Backend developer in training | Kinesthetic-INFP learner | Building tools for family & community

## 🌱 About Me  
I'm a software engineering student focused on backend development. I love solving real-world problems — such as building a commercial site for my mom’s business and protecting my church’s digital archive.



## 🛠️ Skills  
- Python, Java, Bash (Under Development)
- Git/GitHub workflows 
- Strong documentation and version control practices (Under Development)

## 📚 Learning Journey  
I learn best by doing — experimenting with code, asking questions, and reflecting on feedback. I’m currently mastering Git, Bash piping, and professional communication in code.

## 🎯 Projects  
- **Mom’s Site**: A commercial platform to support my mom’s business  
- **Church Archive Tool**: A secure system to protect digital records

## ✨ Fun Fact  
I brand myself as “ElCanDo”(manining "He Can Do") — because I believe in grit, growth, and getting things done.
